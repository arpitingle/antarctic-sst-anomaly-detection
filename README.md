# antarctic-sst-anomaly-detection

Project Overview

This notebook implements an unsupervised anomaly detection system for Antarctic sea surface temperature using:

    Data: NOAA OISST v2.1 satellite observations (2003-2024)
    Methods: Statistical baselines + Deep learning autoencoders
    Goal: Detect extreme thermal events (marine heatwaves, polynyas)

Key Features:

    Automated data download and preprocessing
    Multiple anomaly detection approaches
    Validation against known events (2016 Weddell Polynya, 2019 heatwave)
    Professional visualizations
